# SubstanceForUE5
A port of Substance Unreal Engine plugin for UE5. 

All rights to this code belong to Allegorithmic / Adobe. I merely wanted to help developers and artists out there who need to work with Substance in UE5 EA.
This was a quick port and not all functionality is guarenteed to work, but so far I've had no issues. Once an official UE5 version is released, this repo will be abandoned.

## Installation

Place these plugin files in your *project* under ```Plugins/Runtime/Substance``` and then launch your project. You may need to launch your project through an IDE as that was how this plugin has been tested. Once your project is launched, enable the plugin and restart your editor.
